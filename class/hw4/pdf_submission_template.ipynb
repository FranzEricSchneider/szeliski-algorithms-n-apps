    "As always seems to be the case for these sort of \"relationship under constraint\" problems, the important piece of of the puzzle seems to be figuring how to apply the constraint to the basic problem. In our case we want to adjust the equations $M_1 P = p$ and $M_2 P = q$ such that $M_1$ and $M_2$ can be moved to the opposite side, preferably as invertible $3 \\times 3$ matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crucial part to this problem is that, in the world coordinates, $P$ is of the form $\\begin{bmatrix} X & Y & Z & 1 \\end{bmatrix}^T$. It is a vector of length 4. However, we can can carefully choose a rigid transform for our coordinates in 3D space so that all of the points in the plane can be represented with two in-plane vectors, and the $Z$ value for all plane points is 0 for our transformed system. Thus $P^* = \\begin{bmatrix} X' & Y' & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}^T$, where $X'$ and $Y'$ represent the point location in our transformed coordinates. Let $M_1^*$ and $M_2^*$ be the $M$ matrices with this rigid transform factored into the extrinsic matrix.\n",

    "At this point, in the equations $M_1^* P^* = p$ and $M_2^* P^* = q$, we have an entirely useless column of the $M$ matrices. Because of the zero in $P'$ it's effectively as if the third column of $M$ and the third element in $P^*$ (0) were just dropped entirely. Let's call $M_1'$ and $M_2'$ the matrices with the third column dropped, so now they are $3 \\times 3$ matrices. $P'$ will be the $P^*$ vector with the zero element dropped. Assuming for now that the matrices are invertible, we can formulate our homography:\n",

    "At this point we have shown that a homography exists (assuming $M$'s are invertible) but we haven't actually calculated how to get it. The missing step is from $M$ to $M*$, we know that sort of coordinate transform is always possible with a plane but we didn't how how to do it. That's fine, we'll leave it like that for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assumed above that the $M$ matrices were invertible. Are they always? It appears that unless the cameras are on the same plane as the point $P$ then we are fine, the matrices invert. A common-sense way to think about this is to think about the operation $M_1'^{-1} p = P'$, which is a 2D to 3D projection onto a plane. If the camera is on the plane that operation doesn't make sense, but in all other cases you can imagine tracining a point from an arbitrary camera onto the given plane.\n",

Design a simple fix to solve this problem using the tools you have developed so far (think back to edge detection and/or Harris corner's covariance matrix).  Include yout code in your PDF, and explain your design decisions and how you selected any parameters that you use. Demonstrate the effectiveness of your algorithm on image pairs related by large rotation.\n",

    "   2. ($\\textbf{5 pts}$) This implementation of BRIEF has some scale invariance, but there are limits.  What happens when you match a picture to the same picture at half the size?  Look to section 3 of [Lowe2004](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/papers/ijcv04.pdf) for a technique that will make your detector more robust to changes in scale. Implement it and demonstrate it in action with several test images. Include yout code and the test images in your PDF. You may simply rescale some of the test images we have given you. "
